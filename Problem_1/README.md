# Problem 1 (Sum to N Problem)

This project contains implementations of a function to calculate the summation from `1` to `n`, where `n` is any integer. The function handles both positive and negative inputs, including zero. The goal is to compute the sum of integers up to `n`.

## Implementations

The file `problem_1.js` includes three implementations:
- `sum_to_n_a`: Uses a `for` loop to calculate the sum.
- `sum_to_n_b`: Uses `recursion` to calculate the sum.
- `sum_to_n_c`: Uses `arithmetic progression` to calculate the sum.

## Example Calculations

- **Positive Input:** `sum_to_n(5)` results in `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`
- **Zero Input:** `sum_to_n(0)` results in `0`
- **Negative Input:** `sum_to_n(-3)` results in `-3 + -2 + -1 = -6`

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your system. You can verify this by running:


## Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd Problem_1
```
## Running the Program  
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing problem_1.js. Then run:
```bash
node problem_1.js
```
